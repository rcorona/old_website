I live in a cooperative house with about 70 other people. After our annual Thanksgiving feast I gave a brief presentation centered around the theme of Benoit Mandelbrot's quote: "bottomless wonders spring from simple rules, which are repeated without end."

By showing them a number of examples of computational art, such as fractals, Conway's Game of Life, and samples from neural language models, I tried to convey the complexity of the processes behind our thinking, and hopefully inspired them to be more thankful of being able to experience life :) 

This is a short (perhaps a little poorly lit) clip a friend of mine captured at the end of my presentation.
