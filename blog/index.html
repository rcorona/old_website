	Outside of research, I enjoy biking (yay Richmond Bridge :D), dancing, and am [trying to get] into generative art. 
	I'm also a proponent of communal living, and have been fortunate to get the chance to live happily with a bunch of friends in student co-ops 
	for the last 6 years (except for one year alone :/). 

	I really miss going to music festivals, and have been passing the pandemic by picking up the guitar; Currently, I'm tyring to start learning the
	violin and piano!
