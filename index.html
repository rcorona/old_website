	<h1>Rodolfo Corona</h1>
	<p> 
	 I am a senior at UT Austin studying computer science in the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars">Turing Scholars</a> 
	 honors program, and am fortunate to be working with Drs. <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Raymond Mooney</a> 
	 and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/">Qixing Huang</a> at the intersection of natural language processing and
	 computer graphics. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form representations of meaning. 
	Particularly, I am interested in domains involving perception and language grounding. I am also generally interested in 
	interpretability within machine learning.
