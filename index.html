	<p> 
	I am an incoming PhD student at UC Berkeley in <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">BAIR</a> 
	co-advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a>  
	and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/">Dan Klein</a>. 
	Prior to this, I completed a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program">Fulbright Student Research</a> grant 
	working with <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/people/zeynep-akata/">Zeynep Akata</a>
	in the <a href="http://amlab.science.uva.nl/">Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UT Austin, in the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars">Turing Scholars</a> 
	honors program, and was fortunate to get introduced to research by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Ray Mooney</a> 
	and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/">Qixing Huang</a>.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form representations of meaning
	within the context of multisensory perception and communication. 
	I am particularly interested in language grounding, embodied cognition, and methods for bridging the gap between the processing of raw sensory information and symbolic reasoning.
	I am also generally interested in interpretability within machine learning and communication in multiagent systems.
