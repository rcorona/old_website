	<p id="intro" style="font-size:24px;"> 
	I am a third-year PhD student at UC Berkeley in <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">BAIR</a> 
	co-advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a>  
	and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/">Dan Klein</a>.  
	</p>
	<h2> Research </h2>
	<p style="font-size:24px;">
	Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form concepts and abstractions necessary for high-level
	reasoning, starting from sensorimotor input. Work in compositionality, abstraction, and embodied cognition is of great interest to me. 
	I am fascinated by the notion of operationalizing self-reflection and self-awareness in machines, 
	and am motivated by the thought that studying AI is an 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">introspective</a> exercise in itself :) 
	</p>
	<h2>Community</h2>
	<p style="font-size:24px;">
	I am also passionate about contributing to efforts working to diversify the AI community and make it more equitable.
	Currently, I am a co-organizer of <a href="https://riiaa.org/en/home/">RIIAA</a>, a Mexican AI conference and summer school aimed at catalyzing
	the usage/development of AI in Latin America by forging connections between the Latin American and global AI communities. 
	I am an officer in <a href="https://biasbusters.berkeley.edu/">Bias Busters</a>, coordinator in the BAIR mentoring program, 
	and a mentor in the <a href="https://cejce.berkeley.edu/clsd">From Day One</a> program. 
	</p>
	<h2>Past</h2>
	<p style="font-size:24px;">
	Prior to this, I spent a year working with <a href="https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata">Zeynep Akata</a>
	in the <a href="http://amlab.science.uva.nl/">Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab</a> through the support of a
	<a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program">Fulbright Student Research</a> grant.
	I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UT Austin, and was fortunate to get introduced to research by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Ray Mooney</a> 
	and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/">Qixing Huang</a>.  
	</p>

	<p style="font-size:24px;">
	I am currently supported by a Ford Foundation fellowship and am an NSF GRFP fellow. Prior to this, I was funded by a Berkeley Chancellor's fellowship. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:24px;">
	I am proud to come from the <a href="https://en.mxcity.mx/2016/03/meaning-of-word-mexico/">navel of the moon</a>.
