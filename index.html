	  I currently have the privilege of working with <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/people/zeynep-akata/">Dr. Zeynep Akata</a> at the University of Amsterdam, supported by a
	  <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program">Fulbright Student Research grant</a>, and in collaboration with
	  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Dr. Trevor Darrell</a> at UC Berkeley. 
	  
	 I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UT Austin, in the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars">Turing Scholars</a> 
	 honors program, and was fortunate to be working with Drs. <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Raymond Mooney</a> and  
	 <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/">Qixing Huang</a> at the intersection of natural language processing and
	 computer graphics. In August of 2019 I will start my PhD at UC Berkeley.

	Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form representations of meaning. 
	Particularly, I am interested in domains involving perception and language grounding. I am also generally interested in 
	interpretability within machine learning.
